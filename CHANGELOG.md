Initial release.

- `dtoa` / `ftoa`: shortest f64/f32 to string, byte-for-byte V8 `Number.toString`.
- `dtoa_buffered` / `ftoa_buffered`: allocation-free, write UTF-16 into your buffer.
- SIMD digit kernel with a scalar SWAR fallback.
- Power-of-ten tables baked at compile time (no runtime setup).
- Verified against V8 (tests, `verify`, fuzzer); 100% coverage.
